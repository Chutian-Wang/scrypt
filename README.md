## GitHub Rules
- Do not push to the master branch directly. Always create a PR.
- Code review comments must be meaningful.
- Commit messages must be meaningful.
- C++ files with main() functions should go directly inside src.
- All other C++ files (including headers) should go inside src/lib.
- Make an announcement to all group members before you edit the Makefile

## Build Instructions
- Make a build folder under the repo folder using `mkdir`.
- Run `make` or `make all` to make, executables are now
generated in the build folder.

## Debugging
- GDB/LLDB
- If you are on MacOS, there is a subsitute for Valgrind:
use `leaks --atExit -- <command and args>`. For example,
`leaks --atExit -- ./build/parse < test.txt` will print any
memory leaks that have occured along with other information.
Unfortunately, it sometimes does not provide you with any
information regarding the source of the leaks, e.g. when your
code segfaults. `leaks` comes with OSX after 2020.

## General Workflow
We work in two thread usually. Both threads fetch from the
master branch for the last checkpoint. Thread A works on the
files and make some commits. When thread A is satisfied with
their work, they submit a PR to be reviewed by thread B. Thread
B will pull from thread A's branch and review the code to make
constructive comments. Thread A will then review thread B's
comments and make changes accordingly and make new commits.
** When both threads are satisfied, thread B will merge the PR. **
