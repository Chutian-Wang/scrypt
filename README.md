## GitHub Rules
- Do not push to the master branch directly. Always create a PR.
- Code review comments must be meaningful.
- C++ files with main() functions should go directly inside src.
- All other C++ files (including headers) should go inside src/lib.
- Make an announcement to all group members before you edit the Makefile
